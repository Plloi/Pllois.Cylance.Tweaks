### Installation

You can run this userscript by installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) in firefox (Untested but should work). 
Once installed, just go [here](https://github.com/Plloi/Pllois.Cylance.Tweaks/raw/master/cylanceuitweaks.user.js), and it should prompt you to install it.
